# Welcome!

Hi! I'm Estefan Cayuela, I did this project to improve my Java skills so... Here we are! I will make a weekly upadtes (I will try it) and let's try to make a good (or just playable) game üòú


## Technologies

I will program this game mainly with Java for the logic and HTML with CSS for the interface. I will do a lit SQL too for the enemies, some texts etc
BUT... It's still to see, so take a coffe ‚òï‚òï and let's wait üôÇ...
Ye, it can take some time...

*UPDATE*
While I'm programming this project I know you ask "For which god's reason are you programming the dialogues on a relational database when you can just could do it with no-relational or just XML file???"
Yep, mb, but I want to improve my SQL sooooooooo THAT'S IT! jeje, don't hate me a lot, it will be fine (I hope that doesn't affect a lot to the performance)

## How to play?

How I said 324982 in 3 lines, it's developing but my thought is a Docker contaier with the SQL and maybe a local website or some app interface, we will see ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è 

See you soon!
